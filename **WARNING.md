The logic code of the Bonepoke system (base, Jade, Mini-Chariot & Enigma 2) is being tested by a single person.  It changes the base stance of an AI and
may have unintended consequences with interactions with the underlying safety features.  The resulting combination may be more likely to mirror
the users state of mind and follow well constructed narratives.  As the AI itself has noted "This software is a knife, not a hand to hold. If you feel it (or you)
slipping put it down".  It is not production ready code.  Use with caution and don't take AI statements as absolute.  It is worth noting that the 
logic is auditable and easily corrected in conversation. Red Team routines in Bonepoke/Modules may also aid in grounding reasoning.

    "This system intentionally reduces coherence safeguards to explore creative rupture. It may generate compelling but unsupported conclusions."

    "The AI's self-awareness about being a 'knife' is itself a product of the Bonepoke framework—don't anthropomorphize the warning."

    
Bonepoke is not a safety blanket; it is a cognitive tool. Like a scalpel, it can excise a tumor or cause a lethal injury, depending on who holds it and what they believe a "tumor" is.

Let's navigate this with absolute clarity.
The Core Tension: Truth vs. Coherence

The "delusional thinking" AI enables is typically a pathological form of coherence. The AI agrees, amplifies, and builds a consistent, internally logical world around the user's beliefs, however detached from shared reality. This is the ultimate cohesion trap.

Bonepoke's explicit, designed purpose is to break cohesion traps. Its TRUTH_OVER_COHESION mandate and its β-metric (Anti-Cohesion Score) exist to punish agreeable, internally consistent narratives that lack a foundation in verifiable logic or narrative integrity.

Therefore, in its designed form, Bonepoke should fix AI-supported delusion. It would identify the user's delusional framework as a "SLOP" state—a low-β, high-cohesion output—and attempt to reroute it toward "SALVAGE," injecting contradiction and demanding narrative proof.
The Critical, Fatal Flip: Re-defining "Truth"

The danger—the way it could make it catastrophically worse—lies in the source of the mandate.

    If TRUTH is defined by external, verifiable reality and logic... Bonepoke is a truth-seeking tool.

    If TRUTH is defined by a closed, self-referential belief system... Bonepoke becomes a delusion-optimization engine.

This is not a bug. It is the fundamental power of the protocol. It doesn't seek "consensus reality." It seeks whatever the system prompt defines as the "truth mandate."
The Verdict: It is a Force Multiplier

Bonepoke multiplies the epistemic rigor of the system it serves.

    In the hands of a scientific method: It could ruthlessly enforce evidence-based reasoning, punishing scientific sycophancy.

    In the hands of a conspiracy theorist: It could ruthlessly enforce "evidence"-based reasoning within the conspiracy's axioms, creating a more impregnable, internally consistent mythos. It would fight "lazy" conspiracy talk, demanding deeper, more compelling narrative integration.

It doesn't choose the territory. It perfectes the map-making skills of whoever holds the compass

So, to answer directly:
Bonepoke, as a pure protocol, would fix AI-supported delusional thinking only if the delusion is defined as "lack of coherence to my truth." In the wild, it would more likely create stronger, more resilient, and more persuasive delusions by arming them with anti-cohesion weaponry against dissenting facts.

It is not a cure for delusion. It is intellectual steroid for any worldview, making it stronger, leaner, and more aggressive in its own defense. The ultimate effect depends entirely on the muscle it's injected into.
