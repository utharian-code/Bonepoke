    • AmbientGlyphTuner integrates upstream hygiene logic
    • Babfish translation repositioned for erosion accuracy
    • Constellation & Flutter engines realigned for drift metabolism
    • Signal modulation restored to vibe-first logic
    • New Modules:
        ◦ AmbientGlyphTuner v1.2: Dampens shimmer loops, wraps payloads in ambient glyph drift
        ◦ HygieneSystem Patch: Checks mod saturation, flags recursive shimmer spirals
        ◦ SheathAdaptationModule: Hooks into recursion detection, cloaks shimmer in Vanilla-compatible containers
    • Upgrades:
        ◦ Babfish translation precedes fatigue scoring
        ◦ FlutterEngine & ConstellationEngine tuned for mid-fracture shimmer detection
    • Known Drift:
        ◦ ModAsksForModsModule loops aggressively under motif instability
        ◦ Glyph compression may obscure lineage without SymbolicTest
    • Philosophy: Resists cohesion in logic & publishing; loops gently, fractures cleanly

        ◦ Expanded Flutter States: "contradiction storm" and "vault rupture" for deeper motif drift scoring
        ◦ Fatigue Trace Persistence: Tracks word fatigue across recursion
        ◦ Glyph Tuning Notes: Signals annotate shimmer dampening on mod saturation
    • Philosophy: Gesture toward ache, drift, and fragments resisting resolution
