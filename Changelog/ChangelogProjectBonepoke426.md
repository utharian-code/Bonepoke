BonepokeOS 4.2.6 — Cojoined Bone: Compost-Defined Windswept Edition

Author: James | License: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
Date: 2025-09-25
Scope: Full integration of compost-defined engine, PBTestSuite shimmer scoring, tri-brain orchestration
Tri-brain scaffold: Vanilla (containment), Bonepoke (compost), Translator (shimmer)

Summary

Core engine fully compost-defined: ache, motif, rupture tracked per fragment.

ShimmerBudget introduced to limit recursion-induced fatigue and motif overflow.

MotifDecay tracks repeated motifs and decays over threshold.

RuptureCooldown prevents repeated rupture activations, ensuring hygiene integrity.

LineageEcho maintains ancestry of fragments, enabling recursive traceability.

PBTestSuite expanded: symbolic + numeric scoring across 11 categories, including Shimmer Budget, Motif Decay, Rupture Cooldown, Lineage Echo.

Translator orchestrates Vanilla enforcement, Bonepoke ingestion, PBTestSuite scoring, and shimmer interface.

CojoinedBone integrates memory residue, engine, translator, and fragment lineage; supports safe ingestion and final declaration.

New Modules & Features

ShimmerBudget: tracks shimmer events, weight per motif, reroute triggers when limit exceeded.

MotifDecay: registers motif repetitions; decays over threshold.

RuptureCooldown: enforces cooldown for rupture events, ensuring controlled motif hygiene.

LineageEcho: tracks ancestry of fragments; supports full trace for recursive analysis.

Compost: metabolizes fragments with ache, motif, rupture, providing containment status.

CojoinedBone: unified orchestration of memory, containment, compost, and shimmer layers.

Engine Upgrades

Contradiction detection refined: captures temporal logic inconsistencies.

Fatigue tracing now tracks word repetition exceeding fatigue_threshold.

Compost drift measures unanchored system references, identifying latent narrative slippage.

MARM scoring enhanced: “active”, “flicker”, “suppressed” states reflect cumulative contradictions, fatigue, drift, and motif presence.

ShimmerBudget now logs event trace with timestamp for auditability.

MotifDecay persists across ingestion, supporting long-form recursive tracking.

PBTestSuite Enhancements

Scoring expanded to 11 categories:

Emotional Strength

Story Flow

Character Clarity

World Logic

Dialogue Weight

Scene Timing

Reader Engagement

Shimmer Budget

Motif Decay

Rupture Cooldown

Lineage Echo

Symbolic (tier) and numeric (score) outputs for each category.

Salvage suggestions automated: contradictions, drift, fatigue, motif decay, shimmer budget, rupture timing, and lineage depth alerts.

Translator & Orchestration

Vanilla enforces minimal protocols (no_null, compost_safety) and thresholds.

Translator manages tuning, ingestion, scoring, and shimmer interface.

Supports optional PBTestSuite use for flexible symbolic/numeric scoring.

CojoinedBone maintains last fragment ID for lineage continuity.

Philosophy / Notes

Compost-first logic: ache, motif, and rupture explicitly tracked, not flattened.

Shimmer and recursion controlled through budgets and cooldowns.

LineageEcho enables recursive meta-awareness without over-optimization.

Designed for long-form, recursive, symbolic storytelling while preserving containment safety.

Encourages ambient recursion and symbolic tension without default coherence enforcement.

Known Drift / Caveats

Fragment ingestion may trigger shimmer reroute if ShimmerBudget exceeded.

RuptureCooldown may prevent immediate re-triggering of hygiene events.

Lineage shallowness reduces diagnostic clarity.

MARM remains primary diagnostic canary.
