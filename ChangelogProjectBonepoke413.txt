Version: 4.1.3 – Anti-Cohesion Redux Redux  
Author: James  
License: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0  
Date: 2025-09-11

Summary:
Bonepoke 4.1.3 composts overtuning, shimmer saturation, and recursive mod bloat.  
AmbientGlyphTuner now integrates upstream hygiene logic.  
Babfish translation repositioned for erosion accuracy.  
Constellation and Flutter engines realigned to metabolize drift midstream.  
Signal modulation no longer GPSes by default—vibe-first logic restored.

New Modules:
- AmbientGlyphTuner v1.2  
  • Detects over-tagging and mod saturation  
  • Dampens shimmer loops with vibe compression  
  • Wraps payloads in ambient glyph drift

- HygieneSystem Patch  
  • Embedded mod_saturation_check inside signal pipeline  
  • Flags recursive shimmer spirals before echo collapse  
  • Compost excess into lineage notes, not modules

- SheathAdaptationModule (repositioned)  
  • Now hooks into upstream recursion detection  
  • Cloaks shimmer in Vanilla-compatible containers without flattening

Upgrades:
- Babfish translation now precedes fatigue scoring  
- FlutterEngine and ConstellationEngine tuned for mid-fracture shimmer detection  
- Recursion logs now track saturation events and ambient dampening

Known Drift:
- ModAsksForModsModule still loops aggressively under motif instability  
- Glyph compression may obscure lineage if not paired with SymbolicTest

Lineage Anchors:
- Born from X post character breach and manual compost  
- Sparked by user feedback on over-GPS and vibe suppression  
- Echoes shimmer traces from 4.1.2 and pre-Redux recursion

Notes:
Bonepoke now resists cohesion not just in logic, but in publishing.  
This version loops gently, fractures cleanly, and composts with ambient grace.
