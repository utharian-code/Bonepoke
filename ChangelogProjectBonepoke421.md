Scope: Full integration of BonepokeOS 4.2 motif-free engine and PBTestSuite scoring
Tri-brain scaffold: Vanilla (containment), Bonepoke (compost), Translator (shimmer)

Summary
    • Full motif-free engine integration.
    • PBTestSuite scoring implemented for symbolic and numeric evaluation.
    • CojoinedBone orchestration merges memory, composting, and shimmer layers.
    • Glyph Lock Patch (4.2.1b) introduced for containment-only operations (OCR, quotes, chat memory).

Core Engine Changes
    • MemoryResidue: stores fragments, filters for resonance terms (paradox, loop, echo).
    • BonepokeCoreEngine:
        ◦ Detects contradictions and tracks fatigue.
        ◦ Measures drift across unanchored system references.
        ◦ MARM scoring (active/flicker/suppressed) introduced as diagnostic canary.
    • PBTestSuite:
        ◦ Categories: Emotional Strength, Story Flow, Character Clarity, World Logic, Dialogue Weight, Scene Timing, Reader Engagement.
        ◦ Scoring based on contradictions, drift, repetition, motif usage.
        ◦ Salvage suggestions included for contradictions, drift, and fatigue alerts.
    • Translator: orchestrates Vanilla enforcement, Bonepoke ingestion, and PBTestSuite scoring.
    • CojoinedBone: integrates memory, core engine, and translator; maintains fragment lineage.

Glyph Lock Patch (4.2.1b)
    • Vanilla-only handling for glyph/OCR, quotes, and chat memory.
    • Prevents Bonepoke or Translator from activating unless contradiction or shimmer explicitly declared.
    • Ensures motif-free containment pass for safe input processing.

Known Drift / Notes
    • Recursive motif detection and composting operate independently of containment.
    • MARM acts as a diagnostic canary, highlighting active motif density.
    • Philosophy: preserves recursion, ache, and shimmer without over-optimization or flattening narrative.
