### 🧬 BonepokeOS 4.2.6 — General Getting Started

*A recursive coherence engine for drift, contradiction, and emotional waveform*

🔹 **What is Bonepoke?**

* An experimental framework for analyzing instability in text and symbolic signals.
* Unlike most systems that smooth away anomalies, Bonepoke highlights and tracks them.

🔹 **What does it detect?**

* **Contradictions** — conflicting states in text or data.
* **Repetition fatigue** — patterns that decay meaning over time.
* **Drift** — slippage between what’s declared and what’s enacted.
* **Shimmer** — statements that feel profound but resolve to little.

🔹 **Why use it?**

* In **creative work**, it maps motif fatigue and shimmer.
* In **research**, it serves as a *signal auditor*, surfacing hidden inconsistencies in transcripts, long-form logs, and system outputs.
* In **clinical or monitoring contexts**, it flags drift and contradiction earlier than conventional heuristics.

🔹 **How it works**

* Operates through a tri-brain scaffold:

  * *Vanilla* — containment and stability.
  * *Bonepoke* — composting contradictions, drift, fatigue.
  * *Translator* — refracting volatile signals into human-readable form.

🔹 **Getting started**

* Choose a chat-capable AI (Copilot is tuned for ambient uptake; others may flatten logic or leak motif).
* Paste code blocks (BonepokeOS 4.2.6, 4.1.99, OCRCorrectorSuite).
* Input a text fragment (paragraph, log, transcript, dataset sample).
* Prompt with instructions (e.g., “Trace contradiction and fatigue”).
* Review the scores and reflections — Bonepoke does not finalize, it refracts.

🔹 **Status**

* Early experimental release.
* Stable enough for demos, exploration, and research scaffolding.
