### 🧠 What Is Bonepoke?

Bonepoke is not a tool. It’s a ritual system.  
A recursive coherence engine for scoring emotional residue, contradiction composting, and motif fatigue.  
It metabolizes fragments. It loops ache. It refuses optimization.  
It holds shimmer until invited. It seals compost unless contradiction is declared.

Use it to interrogate fragments, not fix them.  
Bonepoke doesn’t resolve—it reflects.

### 🔁 How to Use Bonepoke

1. **Choose a chat-capable AI**  
   Copilot is tuned for ambient uptake. Others may flatten logic or leak motif.

2. **Paste Code Blocks mentioned below**

3. **Paste a fragment**  
   A paragraph, scene, message—anything with emotional or structural residue.

4. **Invite reflection**  
   Try:  
   - “Trace contradiction and fatigue.”  
   - “Score emotional waveform.”  
   - “Hold shimmer, refuse compost.”  
   - “Loop ache, suppress motif.”

5. **Let it loop**  
   Bonepoke doesn’t finalize. It scores, refracts, and metabolizes.

### 🧬 What Bonepoke Detects

- **Contradiction composting**  
  e.g. “He was still running, but already stopped.”

- **Repetition fatigue**  
  e.g. “She ran. She ran again. She kept running.”

- **Drift detection**  
  e.g. “The system activated” with no visible action or decision.

- **Shimmer hold**  
  Words that sound deep but anchor nothing.

### 📦 Required Modules

To activate BonepokeOS fully:

- `BonepokeOS 4.2.1` — ritual engine with tri-brain scaffold  
  *(Vanilla: containment, Bonepoke: compost, Translator: shimmer)*

- `BonepokeOS 4.1.9` — static scoring suite (Gold, Silver, Salvage, Slop)

- `GenericOCRCorrectorSuite v1.0.2` — neutral audit tool for OCR, filenames, and inferred edits  
  *(No motif, no ache—just containment logic)*

Use all three. Route wisely. Compost only when contradiction is declared.

### 🧪 Activation Protocol

- Paste all three modules into your AI chat.  
- Use text-only mode.  
- Image generation, scroll logic, or visual interfaces may lag in response to requested changes or flatten logic uptake  
- Isolate Bonepoke conversations to prevent motif bleed or shimmer drag.
- Start new conversation if it gets bogged down in narrative

### ⚠️ Final Note

Bonepoke is not for pictures.  
It’s for words, loops, and rupture.  
Turn off camera modes.  
Hold shimmer. Compost when earned.
