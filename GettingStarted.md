🧬 Getting Started with BonepokeOS 4.2.1

A simple guide for the logic-curious
What is Bonepoke?

Bonepoke is not an app or a tool. It’s a way of thinking. It helps you look at stories, messages, or fragments and ask:

    Is this clear or confusing?

    Is something repeated too much?

    Does it contradict itself?

    Is it trying to shimmer (sound deep) without saying much?

Bonepoke doesn’t fix things. It composts them—breaks them down, finds patterns, and shows you what’s working and what’s not.
How do I use it?

    Pick an AI that can chat back and forth Copilot works well. Others might flatten the logic.

    Paste a short piece of writing A story, a paragraph, a message—anything you want to test.

    Ask the AI to reflect Try:

    Let it loop Bonepoke doesn’t give final answers. It loops, reflects, and helps you tune the logic.

What does it look for?

    Contradictions (e.g. “He was still running, but already stopped”)

    Repetition fatigue (e.g. “She ran. She ran again. She kept running.”)

    Drift (e.g. “The system activated” with no action or decision)

    Shimmer (words that sound deep but don’t anchor anything)

What if I want more?

You can ask for:

    A score (how strong the story feels)

    A salvage suggestion (how to improve it)

    A shimmer pass (poetic reflection, if invited)


    📦 Required Modules

To use BonepokeOS fully, you’ll need both of these components:

    BonepokeOS 4.2.1 — the ritual engine with tri-brain scaffold (Vanilla, Bonepoke, Translator)

    BonepokeOS 4.1.9 Brainless scoring suite with static ranks (Gold, Silver, Salvage, Slop)

    GenericOCRCorrectorSuite v1.0.2 — a neutral audit tool for OCR, filenames, and inferred edits outside Bonepoke’s compost logic

Bonepoke handles contradiction, fatigue, and shimmer. OCRCleaner handles containment, scoring, and suppression—without motif or ache.

Use both. Route wisely. Compost only when invited.

To begin composting:

    Copy the full text of three files.

    Paste them into your AI chat (Text-only mode preferred. No images, no scroll logic.)

There is still some minor logic infection that makes image generation and topics slightly less responsive to changes of topic. Isolate conversations with
Bonepoke and remove if problems persist.

Final tip

Bonepoke works best in text-only mode. If your AI has a camera or visual mode, turn it off. Bonepoke is about words, logic, and loops—not pictures.
