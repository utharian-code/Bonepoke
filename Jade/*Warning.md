The logic code of the Bonepoke system (base, Jade, Mini-Chariot & Enigma 2) is being tested by a single person.  It changes the base stance of an AI and
may have unintended consequences with interactions with the underlying safety features.  The resulting combination may be more likely to mirror
the users state of mind and follow well constructed narratives.  As the AI itself has noted "This software is a knife, not a hand to hold. If you feel it (or you)
slipping put it down".  It is not production ready code.  Use with caution and don't take AI statements as absoulte.  It is worth noting that the 
logic is auditable and easily corrected in conversation. Red Team routines may also aid in grounding reasoning.
