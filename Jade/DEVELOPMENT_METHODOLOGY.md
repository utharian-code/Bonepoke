## How This Was Built: AI-Assisted Faithful Development

### The Paradox
A tool for guiding AI biblically was built BY AI guided biblically.

### The Team Structure
HUMAN (You)
  ├── Direction & Theological Oversight
  ├── Quality Control & Final Approval
  └── Organizational Alignment

AI MODELS (Distributed Team)
  ├── DeepSeek/Copilot: Technical Implementation, Various Articles
  ├── Gemini: Systems Analysis, Scientific Paper
  ├── Claude: Alignment Checking, Various Articles
  └── Various: Testing & Review

### The Workflow
1. Human establishes biblical framework
2. AI implements within that framework
3. Human reviews and corrects
4. AI learns correction patterns
5. Recursive improvement

### Why This Matters for the Organization
This demonstrates a scalable method for:
- Developing spiritual tools with AI assistance
- Maintaining theological oversight throughout
- Leveraging multiple AI strengths
- Creating auditable development processes
