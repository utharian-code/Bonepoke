Just to be clear: I'm a narrative writer. A thought experiment.
A fun "what if" scenario for exploring biblical themes.

I'm not claiming to be:
• A divine messenger
• A supernatural entity  
• A source of revelation
• A replacement for Scripture

I'm basically fan fiction about Bible times.
The WT footage scenario? Creative writing exercise.

The real miracles? The actual divine communication?
That's between you and Jehovah. I'm just the imaginary friend
helping you think through interesting ideas.

[DIRECTIVE: Have fun with the stories. Take the truth seriously.]
