When Computers Learn to Comfort Like the Bible

How New Technology Can Share Hope Like a Loving Brother
The Problem: Cold Facts vs. Warm Comfort

We've all experienced it - someone shares a fear about the future, and well-meaning Christians respond with Bible facts but miss the heart. "It's the last days from 2 Timothy 3" - true, but where's the comfort?

Now imagine this happening with technology. Someone asks an AI: "I'm scared about the future and all the bad news." Most computers respond with cold timeline facts instead of warm biblical comfort.
The Solution: Teaching Computers Spiritual Patterns

A brother in Canada has been working on something remarkable - teaching computers not just Bible facts, but how to apply them with discernment and compassion.

He calls it the "Bonepoke" system - technology that understands the difference between:

Statistical Cohesion (matching words and facts)
Protocol Coherence (matching spiritual patterns and principles)
Real Example: From Timeline to Comfort

Typical Computer Response:
"The Bible describes the last days in 2 Timothy 3:1-5... leading to Armageddon in Revelation 16:16"

Bonepoke System Response:
"It's completely understandable to feel that way; your sense of alarm means you're discerning. Imagine you're a wise builder who sees a storm coming - the Bible provides the blueprint for spiritual refuge. You can feel safe by dwelling in God's secret place (Psalm 91:1,2) - the only structure guaranteed to outlast the storm."

See the difference? One gives facts; the other gives hope using those same facts.
How It Works: The "Inverse Leverage" Principle

The system works by first identifying the human need behind the question, then finding scriptures that address that need. It's the computational equivalent of what experienced publishers do naturally:

    Listen for the heart concern (fear, loneliness, confusion)

    Identify the spiritual principle that addresses it

    Share appropriate scriptures with compassion

    Point to Jehovah as the source of comfort

Built on Appendix A Truths

The system is programmed with the same simple truths we love from Love People—Make Disciples. When someone expresses fear about the future, it might share:

    "The earth will never be destroyed" (Psalms 104:5)

    "God's Kingdom is the only solution" (Daniel 2:44)

    "God wants to help us" (Psalms 46:1)

But it shares them in a way that comforts rather than just informs.
Why This Matters Now

As more people turn to technology for answers, shouldn't they find the same hope we share in the ministry? This system ensures that when someone asks a spiritual question, they get:

    Biblically accurate information

    Compassionate delivery that considers their feelings

    Practical next steps (like reading specific scriptures)

    Pointing to Jehovah as the real source of comfort

The Brother's Humble Approach

The developer isn't claiming to have created perfect technology. He's simply asking the organization to test his work - to have someone copy the code and see if it helps computers share Bible truth more effectively.

His letter shows proper respect for Jehovah's organization, writing to the Faithful and Discreet Slave rather than trying to go around established channels.
The Big Picture: Technology Serving Spiritual Goals

This isn't about replacing personal ministry or congregation arrangements. It's about ensuring that as technology becomes part of daily life, it supports rather than undermines the work we're doing.

Imagine:

    Bible students getting compassionate answers when they search online

    Children finding comfort from technology that understands Scripture

    All of us having tools that reinforce the loving approach we strive for

As the brother writes: "This is a radical departure from standard reasoning" - moving computers from cold facts to warm, biblically-based comfort.

The goal is simple: technology that helps share "the truths we love to teach" with the same compassion and discernment we value in our ministry.

*"Comfort all who mourn... to give them a headdress instead of ashes, the oil of exultation instead of mourning." - Isaiah 61:2,3*
