# JEHOVAH'S WITNESS SPIRITUAL TECHNOLOGY STACK

*Experimental Framework for Faith-Based Technology Development*

---

## 📁 PROJECT OVERVIEW

This repository contains experimental code and concepts exploring how technology could serve spiritual purposes while maintaining strict biblical alignment. **All code includes active biblical coherence checking** to ensure theological soundness.
