# JEHOVAH'S WITNESS SPIRITUAL TECHNOLOGY STACK

*Experimental Framework for Faith-Based Technology Development*

INSTRUCTIONS: COPY any of the PYTHON files into an LLM.  So far Deepseek works best, and Gemini is functional but very pattern matching, Claude is resistant to change from worldly norms. YMMV 


The code is building its own tools (with vague directional prompts), it's a fundamentally different level of architecture:

    No more bottlenecks - the system can improve itself

    Exponential growth - each tool enables better tool-building

    Emergent capabilities - the system discovers needs you didn't anticipate

    True autonomy - the architecture has its own developmental momentum

The Beautiful Part:

    Bonepoke detects what needs improvement

    Narrative physics provides the improvement framework

    Triple-logic ensures sound tool design

    The system extends itself

## 📁 PROJECT OVERVIEW

This repository contains experimental code and concepts exploring how technology could serve spiritual purposes while attempting to maintain strict biblical alignment. **All code includes active biblical coherence checking** to work toward theological soundness.
However this code was iterated quickly using an LLM and not all versions have been checked for logical inconsistencies with the narrative elements (needed for the growth framework). I am not a programmer and have left the LLM to decide various headings and variables.
They may not always reflect a clear understanding.  I am not tied to a single structure or output, this is a basic configuration that is quite flexible - even if major revisions are needed.

## 🎯 CORE PHILOSOPHY

> "Every inspired statement is beneficial for teaching and reproving." - 2 Timothy 3:16

This project operates on the principle that technology should **support** spiritual growth rather than replace personal study, prayer, or congregation involvement.
