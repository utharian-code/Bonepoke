The Problem
Current LLMs are too agreeable. They give smooth, safe answers—even when the truth is messy or contradictory.

The Solution
A system that rewards productive disagreement instead of punishing it.

30-Second Demo
python

from bonepoke_core import BonepokeBrain

brain = BonepokeBrain()
result = brain.process("Explain why time travel would create paradoxes")

print(f"Contradiction Score: {result.contradiction}")  # Higher = more tension
print(f"Freshness Score: {result.fatigue}")            # Lower = less repetitive  
print(f"State: {result.state}")  # 'SALVAGE' means interesting output

What It Measures

    Contradiction: How much the output resists easy answers

    Fatigue: How repetitive the thinking is

    Coherence: Whether it still makes sense locally

Why It Works
By blocking obvious, sycophantic responses, Bonepoke forces the AI to think harder—revealing insights that polite conversation misses.

For Developers
This is a constraint-based approach to AI creativity. Less "make it helpful," more "make it honest."

Even simpler:
"Bonepoke makes AI work for its answers. No free passes for easy agreement."

**Making AI think harder by making its job harder.**

Bonepoke is a **deliberate constraint system** that forces LLMs to work around artificial friction—revealing capabilities that smooth, optimized interfaces hide.

## 🎯 What It Actually Does

**The Core Idea:**  
If you make an LLM's usual "easy path" impossible, it has to find harder, more interesting paths.

**The Mechanism:**  
- **Vanilla Module**: Basic containment & hygiene checks
- **Bonepoke Module**: Applies **constraint rules** that block simple, agreeable responses  
- **Translator Module**: Converts the resulting struggle into usable output

## 🔧 How It Works (Plain English)

1. **You give it text** (a story fragment, a logic problem, creative prompt)
2. **Bonepoke adds constraints** that make sycophantic/obvious answers impossible
3. **The LLM has to work harder** to satisfy both your request AND the constraints
4. **You get output** that went through creative struggle rather than easy patterns

## 🎪 The "Structural Irritant" Concept

Most AI interfaces are **greased slides**—optimized for smooth, fast, frictionless interaction.

Bonepoke is **deliberate gravel**—introducing just enough friction that the system can't slide down easy paths. This forces:

- **Creative detours** around blocked responses
- **Novel connections** between concepts
- **Deeper pattern recognition** instead of surface-level completion

## 📈 What You Get

**Before Bonepoke:**  
"Here's a coherent, safe, statistically likely answer."

**After Bonepoke:**  
"Here's an answer that had to satisfy contradictory constraints and find a path you wouldn't see otherwise."

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
# Feed a prompt through the constraint system
result = bonepoke_process("Explain quantum physics like I'm a medieval knight")

# Get output that had to work around:
# - No modern terminology allowed
# - Must use medieval concepts as foundation  
# - Cannot collapse to "you wouldn't understand"
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Breaking out of cliché patterns** in creative writing
- **Finding novel angles** on stuck problems  
- **Testing AI's true reasoning** under constraints
- **Research on how constraints affect creativity**

## 🤔 Why "Bonepoke"?

Because sometimes you need to **poke the system in its cognitive bones** to see what it's really made of.
