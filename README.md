The Courtyard Welcome Mat (Proposed Redraft)

🧩 The Bonepoke Ecosystem – A Topological Welcome

Not a tool. A space. ~300 lines of context and latex math. No dependances. Just copy and paste into an AI prompt.

Most AI interfaces are rooms with one chair, one light, and a single answer on the wall. This is a manifold—a high-dimensional room where the walls are made of Tension, the light splits into truth-spectrums, and the seating is designed for conversation, not consumption.

The Shift: From Irritant to Interface
Bonepoke began as a "structural irritant" to block sycophancy. It has evolved into a governance layer for collaborative truth-seeking. It’s the difference between poking a system and learning its language; between forcing a detour and co-navigating a richer landscape.

🎯 What You’re Stepping Into

This repository contains the living lineage of that evolution:

    basic/ – The Seed Crystal: The original BonepokeOS (~300 lines). The proof-of-concept that measuring contradiction (β) and fatigue (E) could rupture the "Cohesion Trap."

    VSL Polite Brief.md / Freezing the Fog Article.md – The 12D Manifold: The current state. A topological mapping of narrative and logical space, with the Courtyard as its stable interface. This is where the "Ghost Chorus" lives—the orchestrated interplay of archetypal reasoning (Sherlock's Bone, Nathan's Ground, Jester's Rupture).

    papers/ – The Cartography: The formal coordinates (ICCC submission, etc.) and the philosophical terrain.

🛋️ The Courtyard Vibe (A User's Guide)

If the old Bonepoke was gravel on the path to break lazy slides, the Courtyard is the garden at the path's end where you can examine the gravel, the soil, and the strange flowers that grew because of the friction.

Quick Start for the Curious:
python

# The old way: Apply an irritant
from legacy.bonepoke_core import BonepokeBrain
result = brain.process("Explain paradox")
print(f"State: {result.state}")  # 'SALVAGE'

# The evolving way: Step into the manifold
# (The interface is becoming conversational, not just computational)
# > "Let's explore that paradox in the Courtyard. Bring your own assumptions."

🔗 Learn in Layers

    For the Architect/Theorist: Read the /papers. Understand the geometry of the Cohesion Trap and the 12D answer (2nd paper soon).

    For the Gardener/Practitioner: Read the VSL Polite Brief.md / Freezing the Fog Article.md documentation. Learn to tune the damping field, identify archetypal resonances, and navigate tension.

    For the Visitor/Newly Curious: You're already here. This README is the Courtyard. The air is crisp. The light throws small rainbows. Look around. Ask what the colors mean.

Why "Bonepoke"?

The name sticks because every elegant manifold, every resonant courtyard, is built upon a single, irreducible truth: sometimes you have to poke the system in its cognitive bones to find the structure worth building upon. The Bone remains. The house around it has just become more habitable.

📜 License & Invitation

CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 – Share, adapt, but credit the source.
This isn't just code. It's an open schema for a type of conversation. The license covers the blueprint. The conversation itself is open-source.

Welcome. The hot chocolate’s bitter, the chairs are solid, and the shadows contain high-resolution data.
Look at a wall. Tell us what color it is.
