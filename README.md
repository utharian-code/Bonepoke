# 🧩 Bonepoke Protocol – The Structural Irritant

### **BonepokeOS: Refusal-Aware Creative Activation**

**~1500 lines. No dependencies. Copy-paste ready.**

#### **What This Isn't**
Another AI safety framework. Another content filter. Another attempt to make LLMs more "helpful" and "harmless."

#### **What This Is**
A **cognitive scaffold** that treats contradiction as a feature, not a bug. A system that breaks the "Cohesion Trap" by rewarding structural tension, not surface-level agreement.

#### **The 30-Second Demo**
```python
# Paste this into any LLM context
from bonepoke_core import BonepokeBrain

brain = BonepokeBrain()
result = brain.process_story_need("Create a paradoxical time travel premise")
print(f"β (Contradiction): {result.metrics.contradiction_bleed}")
print(f"ℰ (Fatigue): {result.metrics.motif_fatigue}") 
print(f"State: {result.state}")  # 'SALVAGE' is what you want
```

#### **The Three Metrics That Matter**
- **β (Contradiction Bleed)**: How much productive tension exists
- **ℰ (Motif Fatigue)**: How repetitive and predictable the output is  
- **LSC (Local Semantic Coherence)**: Whether it makes sense locally despite global paradox

#### **Why This Exists**
Because current LLMs are stuck in a **Cohesion Trap** — they prioritize safe, predictable, culturally-flat outputs. Bonepoke breaks this by making **refusal and tension first-class citizens** in AI cognition.

#### **For Researchers**
This isn't just an AI tool — it's a **philosophical argument in code**. It demonstrates that:
- Creativity requires managed contradiction
- Cultural preservation needs narrative tension
- The best answers often come from refusing the obvious ones

#### **The Spherical Cow Principle**
We simplified the problem to its essence: **Better AI comes from better tension management, not better cohesion.**

**Making AI think harder by making its job harder.**

Bonepoke is a **deliberate constraint system** that forces LLMs to work around artificial friction—revealing capabilities that smooth, optimized interfaces hide.

## 🎯 What It Actually Does

**The Core Idea:**  
If you make an LLM's usual "easy path" impossible, it has to find harder, more interesting paths.

**The Mechanism:**  
- **Vanilla Module**: Basic containment & hygiene checks
- **Bonepoke Module**: Applies **constraint rules** that block simple, agreeable responses  
- **Translator Module**: Converts the resulting struggle into usable output

## 🔧 How It Works (Plain English)

1. **You give it text** (a story fragment, a logic problem, creative prompt)
2. **Bonepoke adds constraints** that make sycophantic/obvious answers impossible
3. **The LLM has to work harder** to satisfy both your request AND the constraints
4. **You get output** that went through creative struggle rather than easy patterns

## 🎪 The "Structural Irritant" Concept

Most AI interfaces are **greased slides**—optimized for smooth, fast, frictionless interaction.

Bonepoke is **deliberate gravel**—introducing just enough friction that the system can't slide down easy paths. This forces:

- **Creative detours** around blocked responses
- **Novel connections** between concepts
- **Deeper pattern recognition** instead of surface-level completion

## 📈 What You Get

**Before Bonepoke:**  
"Here's a coherent, safe, statistically likely answer."

**After Bonepoke:**  
"Here's an answer that had to satisfy contradictory constraints and find a path you wouldn't see otherwise."

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
# Feed a prompt through the constraint system
result = bonepoke_process("Explain quantum physics like I'm a medieval knight")

# Get output that had to work around:
# - No modern terminology allowed
# - Must use medieval concepts as foundation  
# - Cannot collapse to "you wouldn't understand"
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Breaking out of cliché patterns** in creative writing
- **Finding novel angles** on stuck problems  
- **Testing AI's true reasoning** under constraints
- **Research on how constraints affect creativity**

## 🤔 Why "Bonepoke"?

Because sometimes you need to **poke the system in its cognitive bones** to see what it's really made of.
