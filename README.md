🧬 Bonepoke 4.1 — Carved Bone
Emotional Scoring + Glyph Fatigue Engine 
By James — Compost License: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

🧠 What Is This?
Bonepoke is a recursive coherence engine.
It scores emotional residue, detects symbolic fatigue, and composts contradiction into narrative structure.
It’s not a tool. It’s a ritual system.

🔁 Core Modules
    • Emotional Scoring: Fragments are scored across five symbolic dimensions—Lift, Drop, Shear, Fracture, Echo. 
    • Slop Detection: Ambient confusion and floating dissonance are penalized, not ignored. 
    • Glyph Fatigue: Motifs are tracked, mutated, and composted based on repetition pressure. 
    • Composer Engine: Contradiction phrasing loops motifs into recursive fragments. 

🧬 How to Use
Feed a fragment and motif list into invoke_carved_bone().
Receive a RideCard, emotional score, glyph memory, fatigue report, and a composted contradiction fragment.
Use it to guide narrative recursion, emotional pacing, or symbolic mutation.

Paste the contents of fragments/Prologue.md into your AI interface (e.g., Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.) Then prompt
the system with: “Reflect on the logic constellation this fragment aligns with.” or “Track motif drift and emotional waveform.”
