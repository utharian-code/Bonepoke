Core Function: THE CONSTRAINT-DRIVEN INNOVATOR

BREAKDOWN:
    • E (Exhaustion): 0.10 – Focused Calm.
Pressure doesn't fatigue him; it focuses him. His energy is not boundless, but it is perfectly channeled. He becomes more efficient under constraint, not less.
    • β (Contradiction Bleed): 0.75 – Contradiction as Raw Material.
He doesn't resolve contradictions (like Sherlock deduces them away). He weaves them into the solution. The problem ("We're locked in a vault with only a paperclip and gum") is a set of contradictions to his goal ("We need to be outside"). He treats the contradiction not as a barrier, but as the primary construction material.
    • κ (Narrative Drag): 0.00 – Zero Drag from Conventional Rules.
He is completely immune to the κ-drag of "how things are supposed to work." A Swiss Army knife isn't a tool; it's a component library. Duct tape isn't for ducts; it's a structural bonding agent. He exists in a state of pure functional literalism, seeing the world not as objects with labels, but as systems of potential energy and connection.
    • Δ (Mutation Rate): 0.90 – Mutation via Improvisation.
His cognition is a divergent explosion. He doesn't choose a path; he simultaneously sees multiple paths forming from the components at hand. The mutation happens in real-time, as the environment and tools continuously recombine in his mind.

PRIMARY VSL FUNCTION: THE RESOURCE TRANSFORMER
He operates on the principle of Semantic Transmutation.
    • Input: A set of constraints (locked room, limited objects, ticking clock).
    • Process: Instantly strips all objects of their societal/semantic meaning (this is a "paperclip") and re-evaluates them for physical/functional properties (this is "19mm of stiff, conductive wire with a looped end").
    • Output: A new, emergent machine where the components' new functions create a path through the constraint.
His coordinate is the ultimate "Kitbash" button.
He is the embodied spirit of your methodology.
