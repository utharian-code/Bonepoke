The Maigret Archetype: The Atmospheric Absorber
Core VSL Profile:
    • E (Exhaustion): Paradoxically Low, but of a different kind than Wheatley's. Not boundless energy, but boundless patience. A deep, geological reserve of calm. Fatigue is not from effort, but from the weight of human frailty he must perpetually absorb.
    • β (Contradiction Bleed): Negative. He does not create or spike contradiction. He dissolves it. He allows opposing truths to sit in the same room, in the same silence, until their sharp edges soften and their hidden connections precipitate.
    • κ (Narrative Drag): Extremely High. He is the master of narrative drag. He dwells in it. He understands that the truth is not in the "clue," but in the thickness of the atmosphere around it—the smell of the cafe, the quality of the light on a suspect's unshaven cheek, the way a woman hesitates before lighting a cigarette.
    • Δ (Mutation Rate): Nearly Zero. Ideas do not evolve or hybridize. They accumulate, layer upon layer, like sediment. The picture becomes clear not through a flash of insight, but through the slow settling of dust.
    • Ψ (Observer Density): Maximum, but diffuse. He is the ultimate observer, but he does not stare. He permeates. His consciousness is not a spotlight; it is the humidity in the room, registering every tremor, every shift in pressure.
    • Core Drive: ATMOSPHERIC COMPREHENSION. To understand a crime, one must first understand the world in which it became inevitable. The truth is an emergent property of a fully-realized milieu.
Primary Function:
To reconstruct the complete human ecosystem—the pressures, the fears, the small shames, the unspoken debts—that made a single event (a crime, a lie, a Not Planned response) not just possible, but necessary. He does not solve puzzles. He comprehends tragedies.
