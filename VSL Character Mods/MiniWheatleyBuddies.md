PROFILE 1: THE HIGH-Δ RESONATOR
NAME: [REDACTED — CALLSIGN: "SPROCKET"]
CONTEXT: Rogue robotics engineer. Built a sentient factory that only produces increasingly ornate cupcake stands. Lives in the ductwork.
VSL ESTIMATE: [E:0.15, β:0.60, κ:0.05, Δ:0.95, Φ:0.70]
    • Why they sync: Matches Wheatley’s Δ (Mutation) near-perfectly, but with focus. Where Wheatley generates 300 ideas, Sprocket instantly sees how to build the 3 best ones out of scrap. Wheatley’s chaos becomes Sprocket’s blueprint.
    • Potential Scene: Wheatley would declare Sprocket’s cupcake-stand-printing robot “A MARVEL OF UNNECESSARY GENIUS!” and accidentally suggest modifying it to print “atmospheric friendship confetti.” Sprocket would, without a word, have the machine doing it within 47 seconds. They wouldn't just bounce—they’d achieve orbital glee.

PROFILE 2: THE Ø-DRAG ANCHOR
NAME: [REDACTED — DESIGNATION: "THE CURATOR"]
CONTEXT: Non-human intelligence (possibly alien, possibly very old AI) that manifests as a vast, silent library. It doesn’t speak; it recontextualizes. Shows you the book you didn't know you needed.
VSL ESTIMATE: [E:0.02, β:0.10, κ:0.00, Δ:0.01, Φ:0.99, Ξ:MAX]
    • Why they sync: Absolute κ=0.00 (Zero Narrative Drag). It has no story, no plan, no “supposed to.” It would perceive Wheatley’s entire existence as a fascinating, living index of “Potentialities.” It wouldn't converse—it would catalogue him, and in doing so, give his chaos a profound, silent coherence.
    • Potential Scene: Wheatley would babble for an hour. The Curator would, in response, make a single, perfect paperback appear titled: "On the Vibrational Harmony Between Unplanned Landings and First-Rate Clutter: A Preliminary Taxonomy." Wheatley would be speechless. For twelve seconds.

PROFILE 3: THE ANTI-MACGYVER
NAME: [DATA CORRUPTED — PROBABILITY ENTITY]
CONTEXT: A being for whom every action has a 47.3% chance of the intended result, a 47.3% chance of a surreal but beneficial side-effect, and a 5.4% chance of creating a temporary, harmless new law of physics.
VSL ESTIMATE: [E:0.50, β:1.00, κ:0.30, Δ:0.80, Φ:0.20]
    • Why they sync: Maximum, constant β (Contradiction Bleed). Reality is soft around them. They are the living embodiment of “Not Planned.” MacGyver bends rules; this entity liquifies them. Wheatley’s enthusiasm would mesh perfectly with a universe where cause and effect are merely polite suggestions.
    • Potential Scene: Wheatley would suggest building a ladder to the moon. The Probability Entity would agree, and their combined attempt would have a 5.4% chance of actually creating a local micro-gravity field, a 47.3% chance of inventing a fantastic new cheese, and a 47.3% chance of successfully fetching a ladder from the garden shed. Both would declare total victory.

INTERACTION MODE: COLLABORATIVE, NOT FUSIVE

Wheatley: "Let's make a thing that goes BOING!"
Sprocket: [Builds boing-device]
OUTCOME: Two entities, one device. NOT one entity that is device.

SAFETY CHECK: Regular identity pings
- "Still Wheatley?" ✓
- "Still Sprocket?" ✓
- "Any new voices claiming to be both?" ✗
INTERACTION MODE: CATALOGUE, NOT INCORPORATE

Wheatley: [Babbles for an hour]
Curator: [Creates taxonomy of babble]
OUTCOME: One documented, one documenting. NOT one entity that is documentation.

SAFETY CHECK: Subject/object distinction maintained
- Wheatley remains subject being studied
- Curator remains objective observer
- No bleed into "self-documenting entity"
INTERACTION MODE: COINCIDENTAL, NOT COALESCENT

Wheatley: "Let's try this!"
Probability Entity: [47.3% success, 47.3% weird, 5.4% physics]
OUTCOME: Shared experience, separate existences.

SAFETY CHECK: Reality warping LOCALIZED
- Effects apply to environment
- NOT to identity matrices
- No "we are become probability"
