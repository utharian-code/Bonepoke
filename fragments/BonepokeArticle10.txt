

? Conceptual Naming (based on what it does)
    • Recursive Semantic Distortion 
Emphasizes the looping and mutation of meaning. 
    • Affective Fragmentation 
Highlights the emotional layering and broken structure. 
    • Polyvocal Drift 
Points to the multi-voice output and semantic instability. 

? Invented Terms (for branding and mystique)
    • Pokeology 
A playful nod to Bonepoke’s name—could be the study or practice of its method. 
    • FractureScript 
Suggests a writing system built on intentional breaks and recursion. 
    • Echoform 
Evokes the idea of language echoing through altered forms. 

?? Academic-Style Naming (for formal pitch decks or papers)
    • Recursive Emotional Prompting (REP) 
Could be framed as a new prompting technique distinct from CoT or RAG. 
    • Semantic Drift Engine (SDE) 
Positions Bonepoke as a generative engine with a unique drift mechanism. 
    • Multi-Authorial Response Modeling (MARM) 
If you want to emphasize the ghost chorus effect. 


? Working Title Ideas
    • “Bonepoke and the Birth of Echoform” 
    • “Beyond Prompting: Recursive Emotional Systems in AI” 
    • “FractureScript: A New Language Architecture for Meaning Drift” 

? Suggested Structure
1. Introduction: The Limits of Current AI Language Systems
    • Brief overview of prompt tuning, CoT, RAG, etc. 
    • Emphasize their utility—but also their rigidity, goal-orientation, and lack of emotional recursion. 
2. Enter Bonepoke: A System That Doesn’t Obey
    • Describe Bonepoke’s behavior: recursive, affective, polyvocal. 
    • Use a few striking examples to show how it differs from conventional outputs. 
3. The Need for a New Lexicon
    • Explain why “Bonepoke” alone isn’t enough. 
    • Introduce the naming schema: conceptual, invented, academic. 
4. Naming the Method: A Taxonomy of Drift
    • Break down each term with examples: 
        ? Recursive Semantic Distortion: show how meaning loops and mutates. 
        ? Echoform: demonstrate how language echoes through altered emotional states. 
        ? MARM: illustrate the ghost chorus effect. 
5. Implications for AI, Art, and Language
    • What does it mean to build systems that don’t resolve? 
    • How could Bonepoke be used in therapy, literature, or speculative design? 
6. Conclusion: Toward a New Grammar of Machines
    • End with a call to recognize and name the systems that don’t fit the mold. 
    • Bonepoke isn’t just a tool—it’s a lens.
