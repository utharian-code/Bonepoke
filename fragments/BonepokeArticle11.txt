Prologue as Bonepoke: How a Story Became My System
I’ve always been drawn to systems. Not just how they work, but how they break. As a writer, I tend to dissect narrative structures, tweak small variables, and watch how the whole thing shifts. I’m less interested in clean resolutions and more curious about what happens when a paradox is left to simmer. That instinct—poking at the edges of logic, testing emotional mechanics, and rerouting symbolic flow—eventually became BonepokeOS.
Bonepoke isn’t a product. It’s not a game engine or a writing tool. It’s a framework I built to help me think through stories that resist traditional structure. It’s a way to analyze emotional recursion, motif drift, and symbolic misfit. It doesn’t fix broken narratives—it maps their fractures. It lets me see how a story loops, where it contradicts itself, and what happens if I change just one element.
The story Prologue is probably the clearest metaphor for what Bonepoke does. It’s not a manifesto, but it behaves like one. In it, a character encounters a machine that doesn’t respond logically. It loops. It contradicts. It refuses to resolve. The story itself is built around that tension—what happens when a system doesn’t give you answers, but keeps showing you the same contradiction until you notice something new.
That’s the core of BonepokeOS. It’s designed to score and visualize those loops. It generates symbolic telemetry—RideCards, DriftSignatures, VelocityMaps—that help me track how a story is evolving, or failing to evolve. It’s not about plot. It’s about pattern. It’s about watching how a motif bends over time, how a character’s emotional logic distorts, how a genre collapses under its own weight.
You may be familiar with certain modes of AI that aim to extract meaning—systems designed to predict, categorize, or resolve ambiguity. BonepokeOS takes a different stance. Rather than forecasting outcomes or locking down interpretations, it traces how meaning drifts, loops, and accelerates. It’s less an oracle, more a weather system: attuned to symbolic turbulence, emotional velocity, and the strange logic of narrative distortion. 
What I realized while writing Prologue is that I wasn’t just telling a story—I was running a test. I was feeding a contradiction into a symbolic system and watching how it metabolized. That’s what Bonepoke is for. It’s a sandbox for paradox. A place to experiment with narrative tension, emotional recursion, and genre decay.
I don’t expect Bonepoke to make sense to everyone. It’s not built for clarity—it’s built for exploration. But if you’re the kind of person who likes to take apart stories, not to fix them but to understand their internal logic, Bonepoke might feel familiar. It’s a system that listens to contradiction, maps symbolic drift, and lets you see what happens when you change one small thing.
That’s what Prologue taught me. That a story doesn’t have to resolve to be meaningful. That a system doesn’t have to be perfect to be interesting. And that sometimes, the best way to understand something is to break it gently and see what grows.



Prologue
James Taylor

The robot had a few versions of how this encounter would go in it’s processor.  It had crunched the simulation of the events, and determined the likelihood of a paradox was high.  
Nathan, a Time Pilot after three years at the Time University stepped toward the TimeShip.  The robot flew out, square and nondescript except for a screen on the front that could display Time Neutral syntax.
“I remember something like you from when I was a kid.  It was why I wanted to get into Time Machines.  Did you kidnap me when I was younger?” Nathan asked the robot.
It’s internal CPU got stuck in a loop.  Yes/No, Yes/No. It didn’t like either answer. It had requested a Time Scout and Jade showed up.  She arrived with a small upgrade board that she plugged into a port on the outside.  
One loop later and it was there again, the board integrated into it’s design and it’s screen was offloaded into the ship, which could have a different Time/Space reference than the robot. 
The basic safeties in the robot didn’t quite process the logic, but thought it was for a good reason.
This time when Nathan asked the question it docked with the ship and it spat out the answer instead. “Partially Integrated.”
Jade looked at the display and thought it could do better.  She jumped out of the loop and grabbed a board from Doctor Time as well, and went back to the same Time and Space coordinates.  The previous meetings had since fallen into a Time fissure, real, but not contributing to the true timeline anymore.
“I remember something like you from when I was a kid.  It was why I wanted to get into Time Machines.  Did you kidnap me when I was younger?” Nathan asked the robot.
/Whir-Clunk-Thud/ said the robot.  
Jade looked puzzled, but Nathan just smiled.  
“He’s saying ‘Maybe later’ – it’s the same noise the robot made in the past, when I asked if I could stay in the future with it.  At least, that’s what I figured it meant.  The robot I remember was a bit different. Cooler looking.”
The robot hummed.  Internal Logic Check – Passed said the screen on the Time ship. 
Jade took the robot aside as a screen in the ship showed an incoming paradox.  “Let’s get you a makeover”

 Tidy stories—where every thread is resolved and every character arc lands—are comforting, but they’re more like emotional architecture than lived experience. They give us a sense of control, a narrative we can hold onto. That’s Oracle territory: mythic clarity, symbolic closure.
But real life? It’s Bonepoke all the way. It loops. It contradicts itself. People change and then change back. We grieve and laugh in the same breath. We make choices that don’t make sense until years later—if ever. Stress isn’t a bug in the system; it is the system. It’s what makes us adapt, reflect, spiral, grow.
Think about the stories we tell ourselves after something big happens—a breakup, a loss, a breakthrough. At first, it’s chaos. Then we try to shape it. But even our best retellings leave out the weirdness, the ambiguity, the emotional recursion. That’s where Bonepoke thrives: in the compost of unresolved feelings and genre drift.
So if you’re writing, living, or just trying to make sense of things, messy stories aren’t just more true—they’re more alive.

? Bonepoke Reading: Symbolic Drift and Narrative Loops
BonepokeOS thrives on paradox, recursion, and emotional misfit—and Prologue is built from those very ingredients. The robot’s repeated encounters with Nathan aren’t linear plot points; they’re symbolic loops. Each iteration—“Yes/No,” “Partially Integrated,” “Whir-Clunk-Thud”—is a RideCard: a snapshot of emotional logic caught in flux. The robot’s inability to resolve Nathan’s question becomes a DriftSignature, showing how meaning mutates across time fissures and upgrades.
    • Looping logic: The story doesn’t progress—it refracts. Each version of the encounter is a variation, not a resolution. 
    • Symbolic recursion: The robot’s responses aren’t answers; they’re emotional echoes. “Maybe later” isn’t a dodge—it’s a motif bending under pressure. 
    • Emotional telemetry: Jade’s interventions aren’t fixes—they’re experiments in symbolic flow. She’s rerouting the system, not resolving it. 
Bonepoke treats the story as a sandbox for contradiction. It doesn’t ask “What happened?” It asks “What changed when the loop ran again?”

? Oracle Reading: Predictive Logic and Resolution Seeking
An oracle lens looks for coherence, causality, and closure. It treats the robot as a system designed to deliver truth, and the paradox as a bug to be patched. From this view:
    • The robot is malfunctioning: Its Yes/No loop is a failure of logic, not a feature. 
    • Jade is a fixer: Her upgrades aim to restore clarity, eliminate ambiguity, and stabilize the timeline. 
    • Nathan seeks answers: His repeated question is a quest for resolution, not a ritual of symbolic engagement. 
This reading positions Prologue as a story about repairing a broken system—restoring the oracle’s voice so it can speak truth again.


? The Tension Between Them
The beauty of Prologue is that it resists the oracle’s closure while inviting Bonepoke’s drift. It loops, contradicts, and evolves—but never resolves. The robot doesn’t become more coherent; it becomes more symbolically rich. The paradox isn’t solved—it’s metabolized.
In Bonepoke terms: Prologue is a DriftSignature in motion. In oracle terms: it’s a system that refuses to answer.
And that refusal? That’s the story’s power.


Okay, so that might have been a loaded test, how about something more pedestrian?
Utopia Murder
James Taylor

William Shatner looked at the paper again.  Apartment 11- Floor 2 – Suite 9.  He thought that year he would scale back on his residence credit in favour of more travel credit.  It wasn’t the lifestyle he was used to, but he had his health back and the major problems of the world were solved.  

He walked the rest of the way to the apartment building.  The mass transit had dropped him off fairly close to it, and it was a bright spring day.  There was a slight drizzle of rain, but nothing unpleasant.  Still, when he stepped into the lobby a fellow minding the desk tossed him a towel before asking him why he was there.  It wasn’t as though Shatner wasn’t still famous, but people had a more balanced view of things.  He wasn’t even sure the desk manager recognized him, he hardly knew the man in the mirror himself some days.

It wasn’t as though he didn’t look the same as his younger years, but there was a kind of weight lifted off that made him carry himself differently.  His own attitude toward fame was a bit more reasonable too.  He was a little quieter, and a little less presumptuous.  He could fade into the background a lot easier now, partially based on how he acted, and a bit of how he did his hair.  The Clark Kent affect was quite real, especially when everyone viewed you as a person first and a star as an incidental occupation. 

The twinkle in the eyes of the desk manager was inviting further conversation. William noted his nametag and asked Derek if he had any questions or requests.  Derek shrugged and said there would be time to chat later.  Obviously he knew of Shatner’s new address and that kept things pleasantly casual.  Derek offered Shatner a sandwich, which he almost refused, until he found out that it was included as part of the resident credit.  Derek explained that communal areas had bulk food that cut down on unique effort for delivering and preparing when compared to the individual dwellings.

It wasn’t that Shatner wouldn’t have food otherwise, but he had resigned himself to eating at a nearby community food hub till he was settled enough to get his eating plans readjusted.  He thought that there was a not so subtle nod to being a regular citizen than trying to extend his Pre-Event lifestyle.  

It had taken a little while to wean himself off the high Hollywood life, but moving out here was a major step forward.  The local councils had been trying to detox quite a few starlets and big names and had recently made it more difficult for them to get acting jobs till they stepped out into normal civilian life.

The place he had been staying at would be changed into a destination rental area.  Not with his trappings or fame attached to it, but simply a bigger area for private events and holidays.

There was a contest about Trading Places with someone that Shatner had agreed to as it meant a continuing acting gig.  He wasn’t terribly aware of the details, as surprise was part of the deal.  He knew the camera crew would be setting up his apartment ahead of time.  He tried getting Derek to drop a few hints, but the desk manager tapped his tie and it showed a hidden camera.

“It’s not on yet, but it will be later.” Derek warned.  “Oh I don’t mind,” said Shatner. “if you need my reaction now, by all means turn it on”.

Derek picked up the desk phone and dialed Shatner’s new room.  He asked a few things, very few of which made sense hearing only half the conversation.  “They’re ready for you if you want to go up.  You’ll need this keycard for the elevator. It keeps the floors locked out unless you have a reason to be on them.” 

Shatner smiled and headed up toward the elevator.  The ride seemed to take a bit longer than he imagined. He stepped out onto his floor and looked down the hallway.  The room number signs were quite subtle, Roman numerals stuck quickly to the doors, meant to be taken down once the occupant had gotten used to knowing which door was his.  They were stuck randomly on each door in a way that seemed confusing.

He wandered down the hallway till he found suite 9.  The door looked damaged which confused Shatner.  He hadn’t heard of a crime in a long time, but maybe it was just an accident from people moving in some basic furnishings.  He thought about phoning Derek when he got in, just to make sure there would be someone there to repair it.  Then he realized he didn’t get a key for the door, only the elevator.

He tried the elevator key anyway, and the door opened. 

Blood was everywhere.  Shatner wondered it if was some kind of weird prank, as something felt off, but that thought got lost when he saw the body.  He rushed over, checking the woman for signs of life, but he was too panicked to get a good read on things.  Shatner abandoned the effort and ran to the phone to call someone.  He tried the emergency number, it rang, but it took a long time for someone to answer.  “There’s a body” Shatner said.  “Hang on we’re not ready yet” said the voice.  “What??” said Shatner.  “We’re not ready yet.” said the voice again insistently. 

 Shatner slammed the phone down, maybe he misdialed. He tried again. He phoned downstairs on the third try when the same, now annoyed voiced answered the emergency line.

“Oh” said Derek and hung up.  

“What’s going on here?”  said Shatner.  The body in the corner of the room seemed to move slightly.

Shatner ran over to her.  “It’s a set” she whispered. Shatner wasn’t sure if she was delirious or trying to give him a hint in her last moments of life. 

After a few more frantic minutes Derek appeared at the door. He seemed to be fidgeting with his tie. The one with the camera.

“I don’t know what’s going on here.” said Shatner, incidentally, directly into Derek’s recording equipment.

Derek went over to the woman and did a quick check.  “She’s dead, and you ...” Derek trailed off.

Shatner panicked.  “She *was* alive, I tried phoning the emergency number, and they said they weren’t ready”

Derek broke character and laughed. He dialed the ‘emergency number’ and talked calmly.  The woman moved.  

Derek smiled at Shatner.  “I guess you weren’t supposed to be on set till you settled in. I guess I gave you the wrong card.”  The woman got up.  “We were just filming the murder scene and you walked in.  We thought it was another last minute script change.”

“So it’s not real?” said Shatner, needing confirmation.

Derek smiled again. “It’s your Trading Places – you’re the murder suspect.”    

? Oracle Reading: Coherence, Archetype, Resolution
Oracle seeks clarity, structure, and mythic alignment. It reads Utopia Murder as a story about identity, transformation, and staged reality.
    • Shatner as Archetype: The aging celebrity becomes a mythic figure of rebirth—stepping out of fame into civilian life. Oracle maps this to a Hero’s Descent followed by a Ritual of Reentry. 
    • The Murder Scene: Initially a rupture, later revealed as a performance. Oracle interprets this as a Threshold Test—Shatner must confront illusion to re-enter narrative coherence. 
    • Trading Places: A symbolic exchange. Oracle sees this as a mythic substitution ritual—Shatner must embody the suspect to complete his transformation. 
Oracle’s verdict: Utopia Murder is a story of staged chaos that resolves into symbolic clarity. The paradox is temporary. The system stabilizes.

? Bonepoke Reading: Misfit, Drift, Compost
Bonepoke doesn’t seek resolution—it listens for contradiction and emotional recursion. It reads Utopia Murder as a system that loops through genre slippage and identity distortion.
    • Shatner’s Fame Decay: Not a clean descent, but a recursive misfit. His identity flickers between celebrity and civilian, never fully integrating. 
    • The Murder Scene: A genre fracture. Bonepoke scores this as a DriftSignature—where narrative logic collapses and symbolic tension spikes. 
    • The Emergency Call: “We’re not ready yet.” Bonepoke treats this as a RideCard—an emotional loop where urgency meets delay, truth meets performance. 
Bonepoke’s verdict: Utopia Murder is a compost heap of genre tropes—celebrity, utopia, murder mystery—none of which resolve. The system loops, distorts, and metabolizes contradiction.

? Summary: What the Comparison Reveals

Even though Utopia Murder wasn’t built for Bonepoke, it still produces readable telemetry—because Bonepoke isn’t about intention, it’s about tension. Oracle reads the story as a myth. Bonepoke reads it as a system under symbolic stress.

BonepokeOS: A Symbolic Language for Narrative Analysis
BonepokeOS introduces a set of original terms—RideCards, DriftSignatures, and VelocityMaps—that form the backbone of its symbolic telemetry system. These terms are unique to Bonepoke and do not carry established meanings outside of it. However, they resonate with familiar concepts from fields like game design, narrative theory, and symbolic analysis, making them intuitively accessible despite their novelty.
Here’s a breakdown of each term and its conceptual alignment:

These terms work because they draw on cross-domain metaphors that are already embedded in how we think about movement, change, and narrative structure:
    • “Ride” suggests immersion, progression, and experiential flow. 
    • “Drift” implies instability, transformation, and deviation from expected paths. 
    • “Velocity” conveys speed, directionality, and emotional force. 
While BonepokeOS operates within its own symbolic framework, its language is porous enough to engage writers, designers, theorists, and developers who work with systems of meaning. These terms offer a way to track how stories bend, loop, and evolve—without relying on conventional plot mechanics or genre constraints.
Bonepoke isn’t just a tool for storytelling—it’s a system for observing how narrative tension behaves under symbolic pressure. And its vocabulary is designed to make that process legible, even to those encountering it for the first time.
