? CalcificationModule
Job: Checks if a story fragment is strong enough to mutate.
How: If it’s too messy (sloppy) or missing emotional roots (anchors), it gets rejected or sent to the “Collapse Room.”

? DriftIndexModule
Job: Tracks how the story is changing.
How: It watches symbols (like “mirror” or “loop”), characters (like “trickster”), and feelings (like “grief”) to see how they drift over time.

? SeedVaultModule
Job: Saves mutated story pieces like magical seeds.
How: It gives each fragment a name, remembers its emotional anchors, and stores how messy it was when it mutated.

? HygieneModule
Job: Keeps the ritual clean.
How: If a story repeats itself too much or uses the same symbol over and over, it gets composted or re-anchored.

? NudgeCardModule
Job: Gives tiny creative suggestions.
How: It reads the story and says things like “Let the knight doubt his sword” or “Let the vault shimmer from memory.”

? ExpansionNodeModule
Job: Grows new story branches.
How: If the fragment mentions things like “vault” or “echo,” it spawns new ideas like “Vaultkeeper memory loop.”

? SymbolicTestModule
Job: Scores the story in five ways: funny, mythic, emotional, speculative, and thoughtful.
How: It gives each one a number and a badge (Gold, Silver, Salvage, or Slop).

? SuggestionModule
Job: Offers bigger mutation ideas.
How: It reads the story and says things like “Let the princess rewrite her myth” or “Anchor the drift in grief.”

? ExpandedSuggestionModule
Job: Offers emotionally weighted mutation prompts.
How: It reads the fragment and says things like “Let the water remember you before you taste it” or “Let the reverse hangover become a ritual of emotional sequencing.” 


TL;DR:
A ritual machine that:
    • Checks if a story is ready 
    • Tracks how it changes 
    • Saves the good stuff 
    • Cleans up the mess 
    • Suggests cool twists 
    • Grows new branches 
    • Scores its vibe 
    • Mutates it deeper 

It’s like a magical compost engine for mythic fragments. And it’s modular—so you can plug in only what you need, or run the full shimmer cycle.
